# DevOps Template Repository

## 🧰 Purpose

This repository serves as a reusable **DevOps template** designed to help teams quickly set up a robust CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and environment management for modern application deployments. It aims to streamline the development lifecycle from code to production using industry best practices.

---

## ⚙️ Components

This template includes the following components:

### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / Azure Pipelines (configurable)
- Build, test, and deploy workflows
- Docker image builds and pushes
- Artifact storage integration

### 2. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**
- **Terraform** templates for cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Modules for VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, databases, etc.
- State management with remote backend

### 3. **Configuration Management**
- **Ansible** playbooks for provisioning servers and managing configuration
- Role-based structure for scalability and reusability

### 4. **Containerization**
- Pre-configured `Dockerfile` for applications
- `docker-compose` for local development and testing
- Kubernetes deployment templates (Helm charts optional)

### 5. **Monitoring & Logging**
- Optional integration with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, or ELK stack
- Health checks and alerts configuration

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker
- Python (for Ansible)
- Terraform CLI
- A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS)
- Optional: kubectl & Helm for Kubernetes

### 📦 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/devops-template.git
cd devops-template
```

### 📁 Configure your environment

1. Copy and rename the sample environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your values (cloud provider credentials, project name, etc.).

### 🔨 Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 📥 Application Deployment (CI/CD)

Push your app code to trigger the pipeline:

```bash
git push origin main
```

The pipeline will:
- Build and test the app
- Package and push a Docker image
- Deploy to the configured environment

---

## 📚 Usage Examples

### 🧪 Run CI pipeline locally (optional)

```bash
act -j build-test
```

### 📦 Build Docker image manually

```bash
docker build -t your-app-name:latest .
```

### 🚀 Deploy with Ansible

```bash
cd infrastructure/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory/prod site.yml
```

### 📡 Access deployed app

Once deployed, the output should include the public URL or IP:

```
App deployed at: http://your-app-url.com
```

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

- Modify the Terraform modules in `infrastructure/terraform/modules` to suit your architecture.
- Replace CI config files under `.github/workflows/` (or `.gitlab-ci.yml`) to match your preferred tools.
- Customize Docker and Kubernetes files based on your app’s runtime requirements.

## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Can I use this template for a monorepo?**  
A: Yes. The pipeline and IaC modules support services segregation and parameterized deployments.

**Q: How do I add secret management?**  
A: Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or GitHub/GitLab secrets.
